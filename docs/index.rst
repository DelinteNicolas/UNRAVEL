Welcome to UNRAVEL's documentation!
================================

Welcome to the documentation of UtiliziNg tRActography to uncoVEr muLti-fixel microstructure (UNRAVEL)!

The code is available at https://github.com/DelinteNicolas/UNRAVEL

To unravel has two meanings :

- to disentangle the fibers of
- to resolve the intricacy, complexity, or obscurity of
With the UNRAVEL framework, we utilize tractography to unravel the microstructure of multi-fixel models.

This repository contains the documentation of the code used to combine macroscopic tractography information with microscopic multi-fixel model estimates in order to improve the accuracy in the estimation of the microstructural properties of neural fibers in a specified tract.
